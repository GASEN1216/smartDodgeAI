## Introduction

**Smart Dodge AI** is a Terraria tModLoader Mod that gives enemies and bosses in the game the ability to intelligently dodge player projectiles, making battles more challenging and fun. Enemies will try to evade your attacks while maintaining their original attack and movement patterns, creating a more dynamic and exciting combat experience.

Are you tired of your projectiles always hitting enemies too easily? This Mod will change that!

## Main Features

- **Smart Dodging**: Most enemies and bosses (except town NPCs) will attempt to dodge player projectiles and non-pure melee weapons
- **Preserved Vanilla AI**: The dodging logic is added on top of the vanilla AI, enemies will still attack and move normally
- **Visual and Sound Feedback**: When enemies successfully dodge, "MISS" text will be displayed, sound effects played, and particle effects generated
- **Highly Configurable**: Customize all behaviors through the in-game Mod config menu
